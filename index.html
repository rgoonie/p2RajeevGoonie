      <strong>Explanation:</strong> The design for the McLaren MP4-12C dashboard
      is good, in my opinion, due to its minimalistic design and easy to read
      gauges. The main issue with this is the focus on the tachometer, however,
      seeing as this is a more sporty/exotic car, it would make sense that a
      user would focus on the tachometer to ensure they do not overwork the
      engine when driving using a Tiptronic/Manual system.

      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      <strong>Explanation:</strong> The design for the Bugatti Veyron dashboard
      is not too good, in my opinion, mainly due to the spread of each of the
      gauges and where the warning statuses may be. While everything is
      sectioned off, there is a ton of wasted space around the gauges where
      content could be put. This space could have been used to show warning
      statuses about the car instead of having them cramped in the negative
      space of the gauges.

    <p>
      <strong>Explanation:</strong> The design for the Ferrari 360 Spider
      dashboard is good, in my opinion, due to its simplistic design. While it
      has a focus on its tachometer, all the gauges on this dashboard are easy
      to read. The design is good because there is one place to see all the
      warning statuses about the car.

          <td>Very Clustered/Distracting</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      <strong>Explanation:</strong> The design for the Lamborghini Aventador is
      not good, in my opinion, due to its clustered design. Again, this design
      has its main focus on the tachometer which is ok due to the type of car
      this dash is for and its purpose, however, everything else seems to be
      clustered around this gauge. The clusteredness will make it hard to find
      what you need very easily.

          <td></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      <strong>Explanation:</strong> The design for the Pagani Huayra dashboard
      is good. The main feature that make this design nice is the digital
      display in the center of the screen that can help house information with
      ease. Other than that, the gauges are easy to read and have a nice size to
      them. The only issue is with the spread of the warning statuses that are
      spread out all over the display.

    <h2 id="suggestions-for-new-design">Suggestions for New Design</h2>
    <p>
      A new interface for a car dashboard should be very simplistic, while still
      being able to convey the vital information need. For today's society where
      many cars have an automatic transmission, the use of a tachometer is to
      ensure the ECU is not overworking any gear when making its calculation on
      whether or not to switch gears. For those who have Tiptronic/manual
      transmissions, the tachometer becomes vital. Therefore, the tachometer
      needs to have a sense of presence, but not to overbearing that it takes
      over the dash like many cars.
    </p>
    <p>
      For warnings/problem indicators on the dash, the user should be able to
      tell the difference between a warning and a major problem. Therefore, both
      types of indicators should be in their own respective locations so a user
      does not get confused when seeing any type of indicator.
